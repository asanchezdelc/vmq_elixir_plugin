  This file demonstrates the hooks you typically want to use
  if your plugin deals with Authentication or Authorization.

  All it does is:
   - authenticate every user and write the log
   - authorize every PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE and write it to the log

  You don't need to implement all of these hooks, just the one
  needed for your use case.

  IMPORTANT:
   these hook functions run in the session context
